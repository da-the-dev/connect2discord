# How frontend UI works
I'm sick of keeping in mind how the UI should work on the frontend part, so here's this note.

As the user joins there is a "Login" button and nothing else on the page. After logging in, there's a logout button in the top-right corner. Maybe there should be a proper profile dropdown


P.S. I hate keeping things in mind, don't I?
